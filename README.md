Here are all the Excel projects I have worked on and practiced for data analysis.


## 1. Data Collection
   - **Import Data:** Import data from sources such as CSV files, Excel, databases, the internet, and others.
   - **Organize Data:** Ensure that the data is well-organized, with column headers and defined rows.

## 2. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates:** Use the "Remove Duplicates" feature from the "Data" tab to remove duplicate values.
   - **Handle Missing Values:** You can use the IF or ISBLANK function to replace missing values with the average or another appropriate value. For example:
     ```excel
     =IF(ISBLANK(A2), AVERAGE($A$2:$A$100), A2)
     ```
   - **Transform Text:** Use functions like UPPER, LOWER, TRIM to transform text. For example:
     ```excel
     =TRIM(UPPER(A2))
     ```
   - **Split Columns:** Use the "Text to Columns" feature to split text in a cell into multiple columns based on a delimiter.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - **Using PivotTables:**
     - Select the data, then go to "Insert" > "PivotTable".
     - Use PivotTables to summarize data, create groups, and perform calculations such as sums and averages.
   - **Using Power Query:**
     - From the "Data" tab, choose "Get Data" to import data from various sources.
     - Use Power Query to clean and transform data interactively, such as removing duplicate rows, transforming text, splitting columns, and merging data from multiple sources.

## 4. Filtering and Sorting
   - **Filtering:** Use the filter feature from the "Data" tab to display specific data based on certain criteria.
   - **Sorting:** Sort data by columns to facilitate analysis (e.g., sorting numbers in ascending or descending order).

## 5. Using Formulas and Functions
   - **Basic Formulas:** Use basic mathematical formulas such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT for data analysis.
   - **Advanced Functions:** Use advanced functions like VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, MATCH for more complex analyses. For example:
     ```excel
     =VLOOKUP(B2, $E$2:$F$100, 2, FALSE)
     ```

## 6. Information Extraction
   - **Data Summarization:** Summarize data in reports or presentations.
   - **Predictive Analytics:** Use tools like trend analysis and forecasting to predict future values.

## 7. Visualization
   - **Advanced Charts:** Use advanced charts such as interactive charts and heat maps to illustrate data.
   - **Conditional Formatting:** Use conditional formatting to highlight patterns and variances in the data.

## 8. Sharing Results
   - **Export Data:** Export data and analyses to different formats such as PDF, PPT, CSV.
   - **Presentations:** Create presentations to share results with others.
